This is a very early port to the xbox 360 using the libxenon library,
available from http://www.free60.org/wiki/Libxenon

It doesn't yet have sound, a graphical menu, but will load the file
"SNES9XGX.SMC" from the first available USB storage device, and run that.

Controls are using the first wired controller.
