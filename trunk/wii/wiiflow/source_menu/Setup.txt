SOURCE MENU SETUP:

This folder contains source_menu.ini, default.png, and button images.

There's 2 pages with 12 image buttons each for a total of 24 image buttons. Each button is represented in source_menu.ini as [BUTTON_#].

IMAGES:
I've supplied you with some basic images to start but you can replace them with your own if you like.  Make sure they are png images sized w90 x h90.  If not they will be stretched or squished to fit.  They can be named whatever you like just make sure the image names in the source_menu.ini match.

SOURCE_MENU.INI:
---------------------------------------------------------------	
[BUTTON_0]
image=wii.png	// image normal
image_s=wii.png	// image selected (notice they can be the same)
source=wii	// see below

[BUTTON_3]
image=genesis.png
image_s=genesis.png
source=plugin
magic=53454741	// plugin magic (only needed when source=plugin)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

There are seven sources to choose from and they are as follows -
1. wii = wii usb games
2. dml = gamecube dml games
3. emunand = your emu NAND
4. realnand = your real NAND
5. homebrew = homebrew view
6. allplugins = all plugins together
7. plugin = a specific plugin specified by the magic#

the buttons are positioned like this -
0	1	2	3
4	5	6	7
8	9	10	11

If you like to edit or make themes you should be able to adjust everything like you normally do.  Your images will override the ones in the source_menu folder. But keep in mind not everyone will use button 1 for wii and button 2 for snes etc...

You can still specify emuflows for each button like before.  That part didn't change.
