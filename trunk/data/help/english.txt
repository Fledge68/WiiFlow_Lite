TIPS for running games that crash:
If the game just locks up with a black screen at launch then check to see if it is a PAL game.
  (Press the Plus button on the game screen.)  If it is PAL, then set the game's video mode to "PAL 50Hz" in the game's setting screen.
  You can also use a Component Cable and set your Wii to 480p to fix that problem.

If a game crashes, then try running the game again.  If it continually crashes, then turn the USB Emulation to \"Off\" in the game's setting screen.
