 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *  None of this will make any sense unless you're studying RFC 1321 as you
 *  read the code.
 *
 *  MD5 is described in RFC 1321.
 *  The MD*4* algorithm is described in RFC 1320 (that's 1321 - 1).
 *  MD5 is very similar to MD4, but not quite similar enough to justify
 *  putting the two into a single module.  Besides, I wanted to add a few
 *  extra functions to this one to expand its usability.
 *
 *  There are three primary motivations for this particular implementation.
 *  1) Programmer's pride.  I wanted to be able to say I'd done it, and I
 *     wanted to learn from the experience.
 *  2) Portability.  I wanted an implementation that I knew to be portable
 *     to a reasonable number of platforms.  In particular, the algorithm is
 *     designed with little-endian platforms in mind, but I wanted an
 *     endian-agnostic implementation.
 *  3) Compactness.  While not an overriding goal, I thought it worth-while
 *     to see if I could reduce the overall size of the result.  This is in
 *     keeping with my hopes that this library will be suitable for use in
 *     some embedded environments.
 *  Beyond that, cleanliness and clarity are always worth pursuing.
 *
 *  As mentioned above, the code really only makes sense if you are familiar
 *  with the MD5 algorithm or are using RFC 1321 as a guide.  This code is
 *  quirky, however, so you'll want to be reading carefully.
 *
 *  Yeah...most of the comments are cut-and-paste from my MD4 implementation.

 * Static Constants:
 *
 *  K[][] - In round one, the values of k (which are used to index
 *          particular four-byte sequences in the input) are simply
 *          sequential.  In later rounds, however, they are a bit more
 *          varied.  Rather than calculate the values of k (which may
 *          or may not be possible--I haven't though about it) the
 *          values are stored in this array.
 *
 *  S[][] - In each round there is a left rotate operation performed as
 *          part of the 16 permutations.  The number of bits varies in
 *          a repeating patter.  This array keeps track of the patterns
 *          used in each round.
 *
 *  T[][] - There are four rounds of 16 permutations for a total of 64.
 *          In each of these 64 permutation operations, a different
 *          constant value is added to the mix.  The constants are
 *          based on the sine function...read RFC 1321 for more detail.
 *          In any case, the correct constants are stored in the T[][]
 *          array.  They're divided up into four groups of 16.

static void Permute( uint32_t ABCD[4], const unsigned char block[64] )
  /* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **
   * Permute the ABCD "registers" using the 64-byte <block> as a driver.
   *
   *  Input:  ABCD  - Pointer to an array of four unsigned longwords.
   *          block - An array of bytes, 64 bytes in size.
   *
   *  Output: none.
   *
   *  Notes:  The MD5 algorithm operates on a set of four longwords stored
   *          (conceptually) in four "registers".  It is easy to imagine a
   *          simple MD4/5 chip that would operate this way.  In any case,
   *          the mangling of the contents of those registers is driven by
   *          the input message.  The message is chopped and finally padded
   *          into 64-byte chunks and each chunk is used to manipulate the
   *          contents of the registers.
   *
   *          The MD5 Algorithm calls for padding the input to ensure that
   *          it is a multiple of 64 bytes in length.  The last 16 bytes
   *          of the padding space are used to store the message length
   *          (the length of the original message, before padding, expressed
   *          in terms of bits).  If there is not enough room for 16 bytes
   *          worth of bitcount (eg., if the original message was 122 bytes
   *          long) then the block is padded to the end with zeros and
   *          passed to this function.  Then *another* block is filled with
   *          zeros except for the last 16 bytes which contain the length.
   *
   *          Oh... and the algorithm requires that there be at least one
   *          padding byte.  The first padding byte has a value of 0x80,
   *          and any others are 0x00.
