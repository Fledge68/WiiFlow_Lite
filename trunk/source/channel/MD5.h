 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *  None of this will make any sense unless you're studying RFC 1321 as you
 *  read the code.
 *
 *  MD5 is described in RFC 1321.
 *  The MD*4* algorithm is described in RFC 1320 (that's 1321 - 1).
 *  MD5 is very similar to MD4, but not quite similar enough to justify
 *  putting the two into a single module.  Besides, I wanted to add a few
 *  extra functions to this one to expand its usability.
 *
 *  There are three primary motivations for this particular implementation.
 *  1) Programmer's pride.  I wanted to be able to say I'd done it, and I
 *     wanted to learn from the experience.
 *  2) Portability.  I wanted an implementation that I knew to be portable
 *     to a reasonable number of platforms.  In particular, the algorithm is
 *     designed with little-endian platforms in mind, but I wanted an
 *     endian-agnostic implementation.
 *  3) Compactness.  While not an overriding goal, I thought it worth-while
 *     to see if I could reduce the overall size of the result.  This is in
 *     keeping with my hopes that this library will be suitable for use in
 *     some embedded environments.
 *  Beyond that, cleanliness and clarity are always worth pursuing.
 *
 *  As mentioned above, the code really only makes sense if you are familiar
 *  with the MD5 algorithm or are using RFC 1321 as a guide.  This code is
 *  quirky, however, so you'll want to be reading carefully.
 *
 *  Yeah...most of the comments are cut-and-paste from my MD4 implementation.

 */

auth_md5Ctx *auth_md5InitCtx( auth_md5Ctx *ctx );
  /* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **
   * Initialize an MD5 context.
   *
   *  Input:  ctx - A pointer to the MD5 context structure to be initialized.
   *                Contexts are typically created thusly:
   *                  ctx = (auth_md5Ctx *)malloc( sizeof(auth_md5Ctx) );
   *
   *  Output: A pointer to the initialized context (same as <ctx>).
   *
   *  Notes:  The purpose of the context is to make it possible to generate
   *          an MD5 Message Digest in stages, rather than having to pass a
   *          single large block to a single MD5 function.  The context
   *          structure keeps track of various bits of state information.
   *
   *          Once the context is initialized, the blocks of message data
   *          are passed to the <auth_md5SumCtx()> function.  Once the
   *          final bit of data has been handed to <auth_md5SumCtx()> the
   *          context can be closed out by calling <auth_md5CloseCtx()>,
   *          which also calculates the final MD5 result.
   *
   *          Don't forget to free an allocated context structure when
   *          you've finished using it.
   *

   *                (Note that the length is given in bytes, not bits.)
   *
   *  Output: A pointer to <dst>, which will contain the calculated 16-byte

   *
   *          The MD5 algorithm does much of its work using four-byte
   *          words, and so can be tuned for speed based on the endian-ness
