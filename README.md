# WiiFlow Lite
My mod of the Wii USB Loader WiiFlow

## Description
WiiFlow Lite is a wii homebrew app used to display and launch your games and apps stored on a USB device or SD card plugged into a Wii or Wii U in Wii mode. The games and apps are displayed in cover flow style display.

## Compiling
WiiFlow Lite is currently compiled using DevkitPro PPC r30 and Libogc 1.8.19. I recommend getting Tortoise Git to checkout the WiiFlow Lite repository.

## Installing
As of v5.2.0 WiiFlow Lite will simply be a replacement for WiiFlow. Put it in apps/wiiflow and use wiiflow forwarder's to launch it via the wii system menu. forwarders can be found on wiiflowiki4. for previous wiiflow lite users, sorry but you must uninstall your wiiflow lite forwarder and replace it with a wiiflow forwarder.

Simply download the latest release and extract it to your apps/wiiflow folder on SD or USB HDD. SD is recommended. Your device should be formatted to FAT32.

## Booting
To start WiiFlow Lite you will need the Homebrew Channel or a WiiFlow forwarder channel installed on your Wii or vWii system menu.

## Themes
Currently only Carbonik Abz and Rhapsodii themes are compatible with WiiFlow Lite. Other older wiiflow themes need to be updated to work properly with WFL.

Carbonik Abz is included in the WiiFlow lite download.

Rhapsodii made by Hakaisha is a new theme designed for wiiflow lite. find it here - (https://gbatemp.net/threads/wiiflow-lite-theme-rhapsodii.511833/)

Other wiiflow lite themes can be found on the wiki linked below. but they need to be updated to properly work with wiiflow lite.
